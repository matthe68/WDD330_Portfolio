    Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging
  </h3>
  <p>Errors: Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused by a system error, programmer error, or a user error</p>
  <p>Exceptions: Exceptions are when an error returns a value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error. </p>
  <p>Stack Traces: Exceptions produce them. A stack trace is the sequence of methods called that led to the error. They are super helpful for finding errors.</p>
  <p>Warndings: Warnings occur when theres an error in the code but the program can still run. Pay close attention to them because they can cause difficult problems that don't seem to make sense.</p>
  <p>Strict Mode: strict mode produces more exceptions and warnings and doesn't allow some of the deprecated features. It can help to spot errors early on. </p>
  <p>Linting Tools: They can help you to format your code and make sure that everything is looking and acting as it should beyond the normal warnings expected in strict more. They force you to format but this usually helps to find errors faster. </p>
  <p>Feature Detection: Can be used to make sure that API's are supported and working without throwing a bunch of errors. </p>
  <p>Alerts: they cause a popup to come up in your code and stops your code from proceding. Super useful to use as breaks in the code where you can see what is going on more easily. </p>
  <p>Console: Also super useful in debugging, can be used to do output statements so you can see exactly what your code is outputting at any given point in the code.</p>
  <p>Exception Handling: Use Try, Catch, and Finally methods to catch errors that may occur. For instance, when someone tries to connect to the database, there are things going on outside of your control as a developer that may happen to cause an error. Use Try/Catch to deal with these instances when they occur.</p>
  <p>Tests: You can create test functions to make sure that your code is working in the desired way, these are called test cases. </p>
